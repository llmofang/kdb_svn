To start the game, just execute:
q mastermind.q

The game supports a couple of features:

1) You can leave the game at anytime you want and resume the game later. Just type 'start' to resume the game and you will see your previous guesses.

2) You can give up a game if you REALLY want to.

3) You can check your progress using 'stats' which will show you how well you are doing so far.

Once the game is started, a binary file will be create to store all your activities in this game. Please do not delete!

Other than that, enjoy the game! I'll patch any bug fixes or so in the future :)
