Notes

The philosophy is taken from the phonetic alphabet used by radio operators: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie...

Nobody likes saying 'open parentheses question mark exclamation point close parentheses'. 

The words are chosen to be easy to distinguish and easy to pronounce, especially one after the other.

All the words are legitimate English. All the words are one syllable long.

To appease technical users; parentheses, braces, and brackets all form compounds.
